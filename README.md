# Zoollars

Zoollars is an innovative budget management app designed to make financial planning engaging and accessible. Developed using React Native, Firebase and Expo Go, this app offers a user-friendly platform for managing budgets, tracking spending, and setting financial goals. Key features include a unique virtual zoo where users can purchase animals with currency earned by achieving their financial goals, adding a gamification element to the mundane task of budget management.

The app also allows users to set customizable financial goals, track expenses, and view financial overviews through interactive charts. Additionally, Zoollars encourages healthy financial habits through challenges that reward users with Zoollars (in-app currency) for smart money management decisions. This project was a collaboration aimed at improving financial literacy and making budget management a more enjoyable task.
